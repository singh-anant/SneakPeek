# SneakPeek

SneakPeek is an e-commerce web application built using React, React Router DOM, Zustand, Parcel CSS, and other modern web technologies. It focuses on providing users with a sneak peek into the latest shoe collections available in the market.

## Technologies

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, maintained by Facebook. React allows developers to create reusable UI components and build efficient, interactive web applications.
- **React Router DOM**: A routing library for React that enables navigation and URL routing within a single-page application. It helps in managing the application's UI based on the URL.
- **Zustand**: A lightweight state management library for React applications. Zustand provides a simple and minimal API for managing application state, making it easy to use and integrate into React projects.
- **Parcel**: A zero-config, web application bundler that automatically analyzes dependencies and bundles assets for deployment. Parcel supports various web technologies and offers fast build times with built-in hot module replacement (HMR) for a seamless development experience.
- **CSS**: Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. It defines how elements should be displayed on the screen, including layout, colors, fonts, and more. CSS is essential for styling web pages and creating visually appealing user interfaces.

- **Config Driven UI**: SneakPeek utilizes a configuration-driven approach for its user interface, allowing for easy customization and adaptation to changing requirements.
- **Component-Based Architecture**: The project makes extensive use of reusable components, making it easier to maintain and scale the application.
- **Live API Calls**: SneakPeek fetches data from live APIs to ensure that users have access to up-to-date information about available shoe products.
- **Search Functionality**: Users can search for specific shoe products using the built-in search functionality, making it convenient to find desired items quickly.
- **Cart Functionality**: SneakPeek allows users to add selected items to their shopping cart, view the contents of the cart, and proceed to checkout.
